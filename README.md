# agile-time-manager
A creative, ever-so-useful edition of a calendar app that will allow a user to save events for each hour of their 9-5pm job. The pieces are set, but the finishing touches will be set forth by me. The finished product will run in the browser and feature dynamic HTML &amp; CSS powered by jQuery. 
## Functionality
--    Anyone with a busy schedule should be able to use this application to their advantage! A planner came help even the most organized individual keep track of their daily tasks and stay on track. 
--    When the user clicks on the app, the current day will display at the top, and when they scroll down, they are presented with the standard business timeblocks for that current day.
--    Each timeblock will be coded in either grey, which will denote a past event/obligation, red, which signifies a current event/obligation, or green, which is a task that is still yet to be satisfied. 
--    The program will save your notes to localStorage, given you save task, and will recall it from localStorage when you come back to the application.
